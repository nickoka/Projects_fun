Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe:
This game will involve the user to play first with any game piece
the user wants to play with. The user will play against an AI that
is unbeatable. The worst case scenario for the AI is a tie. The user
will not be able to win. (Assuming the program works as described).

If the user does win, there is an error in the program and will hopefully
be fully fixed as time goes on.

Below is a how the gameboard will be displayed:
